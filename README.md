# Realtime_Stock_Analysis
Live news about stocks and search results for stock prices etc.

## Description

- In today's fast pacing era, it is really hard for a stock investor/trader to keep track of the stock prices and the highlights related to them. So this gave us an idea to build an application, by using which one can look for the stock prices and the news related to them at the same place.

- We created this application, so that that you can look for the any stock's data and reliable news about it, from a reliable platform.

- There are bunch of other applications where you can look for the stock data but most of them are not reliable and do not post the current data, with the current news.

- All three of us are from different backgrounds with different skillset and experience in coding. So we excahnged knowledge and experience from each other.
